# Javascript coding Challenges and solutions
This repository contains Javascript coding challenges and my solutions for those challenges.
This is to improve my Javascript coding skillset.

## How to run?
* Install Node in your local machine
* Navigate to the file that you like to run
* Open command prompt , type in 
* `node filename`
* It will return the result of the coding challenge in that file

### What is edabit coding challenges??
Based on the excerpt from edabit:
The act of coding can be broken into three parts:
* You encounter a challenge you're not completely sure how to solve.
* You search for documentation or tutorials that will help overcome the challenge.
* Sometimes you have to ask questions in discussion forums.
* Edabit simulates this pattern in a structured way, while eliminating the tedious aspects and adding gamification. This approach is far superior to books, video tutorials and other traditional teaching methods because it teaches you how to think like a programmer as opposed to merely teaching syntax.
* It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner, intermediate or advanced. With every challenge you complete, you’ll either learn something new or you’ll be getting better at something you already know.

### Why did I create this repository?
I am a big fan of Slight edge principles. The act of doing a little each day to improve your skill is something that I practise.
Being a Test Consultant, you tend to work on different technologies , different programming languages and different domains.
This repository is the result of my hardwork on improving my Javascript coding skills.
Here, I have gone through the coding challenges,
applied my knowledge or learn some new concepts and provide solution for these coding challenges.


### How to Apply the Slight Edge principles
* A little each day– The little things are easy to do, are also easy not to do. To get to where you want don’t let those daily things that matter slip through your fingers.
* Know what matters to you– Think of your goals, what you want in life, where you want to be.  Write them all down. Put them on your mirror or where you can see them everyday.  Do the little things everyday to help you move toward your goals.
* Show up–  Show up to events, show up to your commitments, do what you said you would do, and do it by when you said you would.  This one can be super hard when you don’t feel like doing something, but build your personal integrity with yourself.  The more you do what you said you would, the more your faith in yourself will grow.  When you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything.
* Have a positive attitude– Your outlook is EVERYTHING!  It effects everything you do, everyone you see, etc.  Find the positive in everything, even if its hard.
* Forget your time line–  It’s good to have deadlines, but know your overall goals may take longer than you want.
* Put in the work– Wake up early, stay up late, take the extra time to make your goals a reality. Don’t let time pass you by.
